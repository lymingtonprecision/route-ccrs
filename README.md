# route-ccrs

A library for calculating the currently achievable best end date and
constraining resource of parts, structures, and routings from IFS.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

    [lymingtonprecision.route-ccrs "3.0.0"]

## Usage

There are two provided
[components](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component):

* `route-ccrs.part-store/IFSPartStore` which creates `Part` records from
  the part, structure, and routing data within IFS. These part records
  form the basis of the inputs to all other `fn`s in the library.
* `route-ccrs.best-end-dates.calculator/IFSDateCalculator` calculates
  end dates based on the calendars and work center loads in IFS, given
  various parameters about the new load requirement. Unlikely to be
  used directly but required as a parameter to most of the `update-*`
  `fn`s.

Both components have a single dependency: a database connection,`:db`,
that can be used as the `db-spec` in JDBC calls.

This library makes no assumptions on how such a connection is
established or provided but it is suggested that you use [Hikari
CP][hikari-cp] (and it's [Clojure bindings][hikari-clj].) (Just be
mindful of the `:minimum-idle` and `:maximum-pool-size`
settings&mdash;we don't want to consume all the database processes.)

[hikari-cp]: https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP
[hikari-clj]: https://github.com/tomekw/hikari-cp

The vast majority of the `fn`s you will wish to use are under the
`route-ccrs.best-end-dates.*` namespaces. This covers updating and
extracting the end dates of part records, and their child records.

### Example

```clojure
(ns route-ccrs.example
  (:require [clojure.pprint :refer [pprint]]
            [hikari-cp.core :as hk]
            [com.stuartsierra.component :as component]
            [route-ccrs.part-store :as ps]
            [route-ccrs.best-end-dates :refer [best-end-date]]
            [route-ccrs.best-end-dates.calculator :as dc]
            [route-ccrs.best-end-dates.update :refer :all]))

(defrecord IFS [host instance user password]
  component/Lifecycle
  (start [this]
    (let [o (merge hk/default-datasource-options
                   {:adapter "oracle"
                    :driver-type "thin"
                    :server-name host
                    :port-number 1521
                    :database-name instance
                    :username user
                    :password password
                    :minimum-idle 1
                    :maximum-pool-size 10})
          ds (hk/make-datasource o)]
      (assoc this :options o :datasource ds)))
  (stop [this]
    (if-let [ds (:datasource this)]
      (hk/close-datasource ds))
    (dissoc this :datasource)))

(defn system [host instance user password]
  (let [s (component/system-map
           :db (->IFS host instance user password)
           :part-store (ps/ifs-part-store)
           :date-calculator (dc/ifs-date-calculator))]
    (component/start s)))

(let [sys (system "database-server" "database-instance" "user" "password")
      pid (rand-nth (ps/active-parts (:part-store sys)))
      p (ps/get-part (:part-store sys) pid)
      up (update-all-best-end-dates-under-part p (:date-calculator sys))
      _ (component/stop sys)]
  (pprint (str (:id pid) "'s best end date is " (best-end-date up)))
  (pprint "The full structure is:")
  (pprint up))
```

## Pre-Requisites

The calculations performed by this library are dependant upon the
free work capacity periods generated by the `finite-capacity-load`
program.

Additionally, the library requires use of some IALs&mdash;the
definitions of which are in the `resources/ials` folder:

* `active_structure_routings`
  Lists all currently active _and tentative_ product structure/routing
  combinations.

* `valid_product_structures`
  Lists every structure for which every part in the structure, at every
  level, is either a purchased raw part or has at least one entry in
  `active_structure_routings`.

### Database permissions

The user account used to establish the database connection given to the
components in this library must have the following access rights:

    grant create session to routeccr;
    -- selects
    grant select on ifsapp.inventory_part to routeccr;
    grant select on ifsapp.inventory_part_planning to routeccr;
